    %p Running FFmpeg in a docker container is cool, but what happens when you want to leverage hardware encoding technologies such as Intel QuickSync and Nvidia NVENC with docker?
    %p What are the considerations for the host OS and how do these technologies play with existing docker deployment /orchestration tools. Are there performance or feature restrictions, and is it even worth the effort?

    %p I work on Google's VR team leading our multimedia efforts. For the past two years we've been busy figuring out how best to produce, serve, and playback spatial audio and video. During that time we've realized that there are little-to-no standards for any of this stuff and that it really inhibits the creation and distribution of content.
    %p This talk will cover the basics of spherical representations and the impact they have on visual quality and playback as well as a primer on spatial audio. Considering this is Demuxed, no talk would be complete without diving into our ideas for signalling VR metadata at a container level to enable interoperability between cameras, post-production suites, and players. What else could be more fun than the intersection of sphere-to-plane projections, 3D geometry, and ISOBMFF?!
    %p If you like to be extra prepared, feel free to look at our draft specifications on our <a href="https://github.com/google/spatial-media">GitHub</a>.

    %p We encode movies and TV shows for millions of viewers worldwide and aim to deliver the best video quality possible no matter what the content, viewing device or bandwidth. This effort hinges on one fundamental premise: that we can accurately and efficiently measure the perceptual quality of a video stream at scale. Simple metrics like PSNR and SSIM do not consistently reflect human perception while large-scale visual subjective testing is practically infeasible.
    %p We developed Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion or VMAF as a method to more accurately measure video quality, and weâ€™ve open-sourced the software. Since this tool applies machine-learning to fuse multiple metrics and features, it is easily extensible by integrating new metrics or adding new subjective training data that can improve the metric. We have used it to evaluate video codecs and encoding strategies. We are in the early stages of using VMAF as part of our automated QC and as a client-side metric to monitor system-wide A/B tests.

    %p HTML5 web video started with black-box video and audio elements, but has expanded with a dizzying array of features from MSE to WebRTC. But what does it look like on the inside? At Wikimedia Foundation, we rebuilt the web video playback stack from the ground up in JavaScript to provide Ogg and WebM compatibility for Safari and IE... This provides a chance to look at the innards of the black box, and how high-level and low-level parts mix. Experience thrills seeing asm.js and WebGL magic, chills at the hacks for streaming URL loading, and prepare to spill your drink as you encounter the remaining low-level limitations to interoperability and performance!

    %p WebRTC is most well-known as a browser standard for cross-platform realtime video and audio communications. But its based on industry standards, and industry standards mean RFCs.
    %p In this talk, I'll go through what WebRTC actually is from a protocols perspective, and take a bottom-to-top approach by discussing the RFCs that make up the WebRTC standards.
    %p Starting with ICE, and moving through DTLS, RTP, SRTP, SDP and more, in this talk I'd like to give people a view of what WebRTC actually _is_ , and give people a solid theoretical understanding to get started with this awesome technology.

    %p The nuts and bolts of JW Player's implementation of VP9 transcoding and delivery through DASH. Why choose VP9 and DASH even though over 80% of video is delivered with H.264 over HLS today? The choice of technology is being driven by the ever growing needs of our publishers and viewers. We are looking to provide a viable and cost effective alternative to H.264/H.265 over HLS to deliver high quality video for users on constrained bandwidth devices. Here we outline our experiments with quality, encoding speed, bytes delivered and lower time to first frame.

    %p Media Source Extensions promise some amazing new capabilities for web video. Once you take that shiny new API out of the garage though, you'll discover a number of delightful quirks that can make it quite difficult to be successful with. This talk will go over a bunch of rough edges in the spec and implementations, discuss popular workarounds, and propose some practical improvements that could make MSE easier to work with.

        About us

      %p
        Demuxed is simply engineers talking about video technology. After <span class="strike">two</span> three years of chatting about video at the
        %a{href: "https://sfvideo.org"} SF Video Technology Meetup
        , we've decided it's time for an engineer-first event with quality technical talks about video. Our focus is on
        video delivered over the web, but topics cover anything from encoding to playback and more!

      %h3
        Who's organizing this?

      %p
        Most of the boring work is done by
        %a{href: "https://twitter.com/matt_mcclure"} @matt_mcclure
        (and others) from
        %a{href:"https://mux.com"} Mux,
        (any resemblance in name is purely coincidental) but there was an amazing group of people from the meetup
        dubbed the "Braintrust." This crew gets together and talks through the submissions, argues
        heatedly over which talk submissions should make the final cut, and helps plan the final schedule.

      %p
        This event is run with the help of the members of the
        %a{href: "https://sfvideo.org"} SF Video Technology Meetup.
        We're incredibly lucky to have a community of engineers that work on some of the best video products on the web.

        After Party
      %p
        When the dust has settled and the talks are done,
        %a{href: "https://brightcove.com"} Brightcove
        is hosting a conference party at
        %a{href:"http://mrsmithssf.com/"}
          Mr. Smith's
        within walking distance of Ellation. The conference schedule is pretty packed, so this is the perfect time to catch up with all your fellow attendees. We'll have heavy appetizers and an open bar until the tab runs out or the bar kicks us out.

      %p
        The only thing you need to get in is your badge, so make sure to bring it with you! Plus ones are welcome, but they either need to meet you at the door to get a wristband or have a wristband in advance.
